# Techdegree-Project-1
This is a number-guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. 
The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and how many attempts have been made. 
The user can play the game multiple times, and the program keeps track of each session's lowest score (i.e., the fewest number of attempts). 
To play the game, run the program and follow the prompts.


To work the game, run the program in a Python environment. The program will prompt the user for their name, and then start the game. 
The user will be asked to guess a number between 1 and 20. If the user inputs an invalid value, they will be prompted to try again. 
If the user guesses the correct number, they will be given their score and asked if they want to play again. If the user chooses to play again, the program will keep track of their high score. 
If the user chooses to quit the game, the program will terminate.
